Inside a box, is another box, and inside that box....

1. **Lab Devices:** At the moment, a few NX-OSv devices and a NX-OSv 9K device.  

1. **Lab Topology:** Don't have one yet - devices are accessible via their mgmt interfaces - enough to do homework assignments week #1.  Will be building something out soon.


FWIW, I've been practicing the smaller concepts from Week 2 and Week 3 on our production network. :)  At the same time, in my daily job, terrible Python scripts (my college Pascal instructor would be apalled) is my crutch until Ansible becomes ingrained in my brain.
